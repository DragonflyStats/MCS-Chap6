16. Chaining
Data.Table offers unique features there makes it even more powerful and truly a swiss army knife for data manipulation.

First lets understand what chaining is.

Using chaining, you can do multiple datatable operatations one after the other without having to store intermediate results.

For example, instead of writing two statements you can do it on one.

Below code sorts after grouping by cyl:

dt1 <- mtcars_dt[, .(mean_mpg=mean(mpg),
                     mean_disp=mean(disp),
                     mean_wt=mean(wt),
                     mean_qsec=mean(qsec)), by=cyl]
output <- dt1[order(cyl), ]
output
With chaining, that is, by attaching the square brackets at the end, itâ€™s done in one step.

output <- mtcars_dt[, .(mean_mpg=mean(mpg),
                     mean_disp=mean(disp),
                     mean_wt=mean(wt),
                     mean_qsec=mean(qsec)), by=cyl][order(cyl), ]
Actually, chaining is available in dataframes as well, but with features like by, it becomes convenient to use on a data.table.
