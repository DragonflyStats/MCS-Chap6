Merging / Joins

The merging in data.table is very similar to base R merge() function. The only difference is data.table by default takes common key variable as a primary key to merge two datasets. Whereas, data.frame takes common variable name as a primary key to merge the datasets.

Sample Data
(dt1 <- data.table(A = letters[rep(1:3, 2)], X = 1:6, key = "A"))
(dt2 <- data.table(A = letters[rep(2:4, 2)], Y = 6:1, key = "A"))
Inner Join

It returns all the matching observations in both the datasets.
merge(dt1, dt2, by="A")

Left Join

It returns all observations from the left dataset and the matched observations from the right dataset.
merge(dt1, dt2, by="A", all.x = TRUE)

Right Join

It returns all observations from the right dataset and the matched observations from the left dataset.
merge(dt1, dt2, by="A", all.y = TRUE)

Full Join

It return all rows when there is a match in one of the datasets.
merge(dt1, dt2, all=TRUE)




Rolling Joins
It supports rolling joins. They are commonly used for analyzing time series data. A very R packages supports these kind of joins.

19. How to join two or more datatables
The data.table package provides a faster implementation of the merge() function. The syntax is pretty much the same as base Râ€™s merge().

dt1 <- mtcars_dt[5:25,.(carname, mpg, cyl)]
dt2 <- mtcars_dt[1:10, .(carname, gear)]
dt3 <- mtcars_dt[2:12, .(carname, disp)]
# Inner Join
merge(dt1, dt2, by='carname')
#> <returns 6 rows>

# Left Join
merge(dt1, dt2, by='carname', all.x = T)
#> <returns 21 rows>

# Outer Join
merge(dt1, dt2, by='carname', all = T)  
#> <returns 25 rows>
20. How to merge multiple data.tables in one shot
This is bit of a hack by using the Reduce() function to repeatedly merge multiple data.tables stored in a list. Reduce() takes in a function that has to be applied consequtively (which is merge_func in this case) and a list that stores the arguments for function.

# Merge multiple data.tables 
dt_list    <- list(dt1, dt2, dt3)
merge_func <- function(...) merge(..., all = TRUE, by='carname')
dt_merged  <- Reduce(merge_func, dt_list)
#> <returns 25 rows from outer join>
