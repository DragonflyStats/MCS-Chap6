SQL's RANK OVER PARTITION

In SQL, Window functions are very useful for solving complex data problems. 
RANK OVER PARTITION is the most popular window function. It can be easily translated in data.table with the help of frank() function. 
frank() is similar to base R's rank() function but much faster. See the code below.
dt = mydata[, rank:=frank(-distance,ties.method = "min"), by=carrier]
In this case, we are calculating rank of variable 'distance' by 'carrier'. We are assigning rank 1 to the highest value of 'distance' within unique values of 'carrier'.


Cumulative SUM by GROUP

We can calculate cumulative sum by using cumsum() function.
dat = mydata[, cum:=cumsum(distance), by=carrier]

Lag and Lead

The lag and lead of a variable can be calculated with shift() function. The syntax of shift() function is as follows - shift(variable_name, number_of_lags, type=c("lag", "lead"))
DT <- data.table(A=1:5)
DT[ , X := shift(A, 1, type="lag")]
DT[ , Y := shift(A, 1, type="lead")]

Between and LIKE Operator

We can use %between% operator to define a range. It is inclusive of the values of both the ends.
DT = data.table(x=6:10)
DT[x %between% c(7,9)]
The %like% is mainly used to find all the values that matches a pattern.
DT = data.table(Name=c("dep_time","dep_delay","arrival"), ID=c(2,3,4))
DT[Name %like% "dep"]
